# DataScience-Yelp-Final-Project
For my final project in my data science course I analyzed information I gathered from the Yelp Fusion API.

I used scikitlearn, matplotlib, Pandas, and Requests to gather and analyze data from Yelp.com

In my project I looked to see if there was a significant difference between Baltimore and D.C. restuarants based on their rating by using Inferential statistics processes of Boot Strapping and P-value hypothesis.

I then used Logistic Regression to see I could predict if a Restaurant 'is claimed' by the Number of Reviews a Restaurant has.

I used Clustering to see What I could learn by Clustering By Review Count Rating and Price.
